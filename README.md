# Excido

Excido is a sample, full-stack, Single Page Application made by Bill Fugina using Angular and the Microsoft .NET framework.
See a working demo at [www.excido.net](http://www.excido.net)

If you would like to follow the progress or learn more about the tools and technologies used in building this app,
please visit my other site, [BAM Apps](http://bamapps.com/).

The plan is for Excido to become a content sharing service where content can be set to expire and disappear.
At the moment, it is simply a short-link service.
You may create a short link in the http://exci.do/ namespace that redirects to any other valid link.

Your short link must end in a unique slug and must form a valid HTML URL. 
There is currently no error checking, so invalid URLs will probably crash the software. Use at your own risk.
